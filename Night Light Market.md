Each type is made for different users' needs and tastes. Night lights can also come in different styles, like wall-mounted lights, table lamps, and artistic lights, so people can choose ones that match their room's design. With the rise of ""smart home"" technologies, night lights now have features that let them link to the internet. Smart night lights can be controlled from afar using smartphone apps or voice helpers. This lets users change settings like brightness, color, and when the light turns on and off.
