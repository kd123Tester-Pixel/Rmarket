<p>Thermal transfer Ribbon is used for printing barcodes or identification labels. Thermal Transfer Ribbon is done for purposes where hardwearing is needed so that it can withstand any chemical or heat. These polyester films are coated with different layers of ink to produce your desired effect. Typically, there are four layers of ribbon: backing, release, base PET and ink. The backing layer is for the smooth running of the printer and to prevent damage to the print head. The release layer is applied for better ink release. The thermal transfer printing process involves the transfer of ink through the ribbon. When it goes underneath the printhead, the heat melts the ribbon, and ink gets on the printed label material.</p>
<p>The thermal transfer ribbons are made of either wax or resin or combined (wax resin); it depends on the use of the printer. These define the sensitivity of the ribbon. The resin-made ribbons have less sensitivity to heat under the printer head, wax-Resin has medium sensitivity to heat under the printer head, and wax has high sensitivity under the printer head.</p>
